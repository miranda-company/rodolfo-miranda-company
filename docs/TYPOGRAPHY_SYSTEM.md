# Typography system

This document defines the semantic typography contract for Rodolfo Miranda Company. A heading level is selected from the document structure first; its appearance always comes from the global level selector in `src/styles/global.css`.

## Font responsibilities

- **Spectral, weight 500:** all semantic headings from H1 through H6, plus a small number of explicitly non-heading editorial display treatments.
- **Instrument Sans Variable:** introductions, body copy, supporting copy, controls and interface text.
- **IBM Plex Mono:** indices, dates, kickers, metadata, status labels, filter labels, eyebrows and technical annotations. These labels remain paragraphs, spans, legends, time elements or other appropriate non-heading elements.

## Heading scale

| Level | Semantic role                                   | Size                                         | Line height | Letter spacing |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| H1    | Page title                                      | `clamp(64px, 5vw, 72px)`; `64px` below 768px | `1`         | `-0.06em`      |
| H2    | Primary page section or top-level content card  | `clamp(35px, 3.5vw, 39px)`                   | `1`         | `-0.045em`     |
| H3    | Subsection or content item nested beneath an H2 | `clamp(27px, 2.35vw, 30px)`                  | `1.05`      | `-0.035em`     |
| H4    | Nested item                                     | `23px`                                       | `1.1`       | `-0.025em`     |
| H5    | Minor nested heading                            | `20px`                                       | `1.15`      | `-0.02em`      |
| H6    | Deepest meaningful heading                      | `17px`                                       | `1.2`       | `-0.015em`     |

Every level uses Spectral at weight 500. At any one viewport, every rendered instance of a heading level must have the same computed font family, size, weight, line height and letter spacing.

Component selectors may change only layout concerns such as margin, width, color, position and wrapping. A component variant must never override a heading's font family, size, weight, line height or letter spacing, and component heading selectors must not use the `font` shorthand.

## Choosing a heading level

1. H1 names the page. Each page has one H1.
2. H2 starts a primary section under the page title or names a top-level content card.
3. H3 names a subsection or item belonging to an H2 section.
4. H4 through H6 are reserved for genuinely deeper content nesting.
5. Never select a heading level to obtain a particular size.
6. Never use H4 through H6 for small technical labels. Use a non-heading element and the mono role instead.
7. Do not skip a level when the content has an intermediate parent section.

## Non-heading roles

The shared roles below are tokens in `src/styles/global.css`. Elements may have different margins, widths and colors while retaining the same typographic role.

| Role                | Font                     | Size                                         | Line height | Typical use                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Introduction / lead | Instrument Sans Variable | `clamp(19px, 2vw, 24px)`; `18px` below 768px | `1.2`       | Archive introductions, article summaries and editorial leads          |
| Standard body       | Instrument Sans Variable | `18px`                                       | `1.62`      | Biography, note prose, reference commentary and provisional body copy |
| Small / supporting  | Instrument Sans Variable | `13px`                                       | `1.4`       | Section explanations and supporting descriptions                      |
| Mono metadata       | IBM Plex Mono            | `10px`                                       | `1.4`       | Shared hero and record metadata                                       |
| Kicker              | IBM Plex Mono            | `12px`                                       | `normal`    | Page eyebrow above an archive-index H1                                |

The shared `.kicker` utility in `src/styles/global.css` is the source of truth for page kickers. It sets the mono family, `12px` size, `0.045em` letter spacing and `17px` bottom margin. Use it alongside the route-specific hook when one is useful, for example `class="kicker notes-kicker"`, `class="kicker media-kicker"`, `class="kicker portfolio-kicker"` or `class="kicker yo-kicker"`. The route-specific classes should not duplicate or override the shared typography and spacing unless a documented design requirement calls for a genuine exception.

Dense card copy, display positioning statements, bylines and micro-annotations are distinct roles because their available space or purpose differs. They must have dedicated selectors and must not be implemented with semantic heading elements.

## Current page examples

### Homepage

- H1: “Hola mundo!”.
- H2: the four archive-card titles and “Lo último”.
- H3 beneath “Lo último”: “Notas recientes”, “En la mediateca” and
  “Portafolio”.
- Archive numbers, dates and section labels are mono non-headings.

### Yo

- H1: “Rodolfo Miranda”.
- H2: “Sobre el trabajo”, “En este momento”, “Trayectoria” and “¿Cómo llegué hasta aquí?”.
- H3 beneath “Trayectoria”: each career role.
- Organization names are subordinate paragraphs, not part of the H3.

### Notas

- Index H1: “Notas”.
- Each garden card title is H2, including featured, standard, compact and visual variants.
- Detail H1: the note title.
- Markdown article sections and “Conexiones” are H2. Future subsections within those sections use H3.

### Mediateca

- Index H1: “Mediateca”.
- H2: “Libros favoritos” and “Otras cosicas interesantes”.
- H3: each shelf title and catalogue-card title beneath its H2 section.
- Detail H1: the reference title.
- H2: commentary, context, recurring ideas, editorial content and the parent “Conexiones” area.
- H3 beneath “Conexiones”: “Notas relacionadas” and “En la Mediateca”.

### Portafolio

- Index H1: “Portafolio”.
- Index H2: the visually hidden “Buscar y filtrar proyectos” section label.
- Index H3: each project title within that selection.
- Detail H1: the project title.
- Detail H2: Markdown case-study sections and the parent “Conexiones” rail.
- Detail H3: genuine Markdown subsections and populated connection groups.
- Archive numbers, years, statuses, roles and dates remain mono non-headings.
- Portfolio CSS controls layout and spacing only; it does not override the
  global family, size, weight, line height or letter spacing of headings.

### Provisional routes

- The route title is H1.
- Future sections begin at H2 and nest in order. Provisional kickers, dates and statuses remain non-heading mono labels.

## Review checklist

- Confirm the page has exactly one H1.
- Read the complete H1–H6 outline without considering visual size.
- Confirm that each H3 has a meaningful H2 parent and that no level is skipped.
- Compare the computed five-property typography tuple for every rendered H1, H2 and H3 at the target viewport.
- Reject component variants that alter heading typography, even when the result looks visually convenient.
